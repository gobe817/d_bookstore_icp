# Bookstore Canister

## Overview

The **Bookstore Canister** is a decentralized application (DApp) running on the **Internet Computer**. It manages a virtual bookstore with functionalities for customers, books, and book assets. This backend allows for user authentication, book creation and assignment, asset depreciation, comments on books, and more. 

This project utilizes **Candid** for type serialization, **StableBTreeMap** for persistent storage, and the **IC SDK** to implement the canister's functionality.

## Key Features

- **User Roles**: Three types of roles: Admin, Store Manager, and Customer.
- **Books**: Create books, assign them to customers, and update their status (Available, Sold, Reserved).
- **Book Assets**: Track assets associated with books (e.g., hardcover, paperback), calculate depreciation, and manage asset assignments.
- **Customer Management**: Create customers, authenticate them, and manage their roles.
- **Comments**: Customers can leave comments on books.
- **Persistence**: Stable storage is used to keep track of books, customers, and assets.

## Prerequisites

- **Rust**: Install the Rust programming language via [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
- **DFINITY SDK**: Install the DFINITY SDK to interact with the Internet Computer. You can follow the installation instructions [here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developers-guide/install/).
- **Cargo**: Ensure you have `cargo` (Rust's package manager) installed to manage dependencies and build the project.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd bookstore
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
   ```

3. Install `candid-extractor` for generating the `.did` file:
   ```bash
   cargo install candid-extractor
   ```

4. Extract the Candid interface description:
   ```bash
   candid-extractor target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/bookstore.wasm > bookstore.did
   ```

5. Deploy the canister to the Internet Computer.
